# Manhunt
the Manhunt game mode that the famous YouTuber Dream invented, and with the cool records and moves he showcased in it, he contributed to the popularity of this mini-game.

-------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, I came in and rewrote this plugin so you can also enjoy my Manhunt experience.

------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation method:

1- Download the file.
2- Transfer the file to your server's plugin folder.
3- Run your server

------------------------------------------------------------

# Commands:

/hunter add/remove [player name] to add or remove a hunter.

/runner add/remove [player name] to add or remove a player from the hunter list.

/meffect [effect name] [effect power] [runner/hunter] to give a specific effect to the hunter or runner for the entire game.

/mstop to end my Manhunt.

--------------------------------------------------------------

When the Manhunt starts, the hunter receives a type of compass that they can use to get closer to the hunters by right-clicking on it.
